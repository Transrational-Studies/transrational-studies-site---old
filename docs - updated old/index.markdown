**What does transrational mean?**
> Transrational, transrational experience or transrational reality refers to the experience of phenomena occurring within the natural universe where information and experiences does not readily fit into the typical cause and effect structure; the kinds of experience that are often dismissed as unfathomable or superstitious. [^1]

**So, why the name?**
I chose the name Transrational Studies because I believe that there are things that are beyond our understanding, but still deserve to be explored. I feel that consciousness is one of those things that we have yet to fully grasp. By accessing states of expanded awareness we can reflect on our conscious state of being in ways that can be profoundly healing and even euphoric.
